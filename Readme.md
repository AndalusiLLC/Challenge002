### **Task: Create a Crop Image Screen**

#### **Objective**

Develop an Android application with **two screens**:

1. A main screen where users can select an image from the gallery, preview it, and initiate cropping.
2. A crop screen where users can adjust the crop area, apply changes, or cancel.

---

### **Functional Requirements**

#### **Main Screen**

1. **Layout**

   - The main screen should contain:
     - Two buttons: "Pick Image" and "Crop".
     - An **image preview** area to display:
       - The selected image (after picking from the gallery).
       - The cropped image (if cropping has been applied).

2. **Pick Image Button**

   - When the "Pick Image" button is pressed, allow the user to select an image from the device's gallery.
   - Once an image is selected, display it in the **image preview** area on the main screen.

3. **Crop Button**

   - The "Crop" button should only be enabled when an image is selected in the **image preview**.
   - Pressing the "Crop" button should present the **crop screen** with:
     - The currently selected image.
     - The current crop state (if any previous cropping has been applied).

4. **Image Preview**
   - Display the selected image in the **image preview** area after it is picked from the gallery.
   - If the user crops the image, update the **image preview** to show the cropped result.
   - Allow the user to crop the image multiple times, with each crop being reflected in the **image preview**.

#### **Crop Screen**

1. **Crop Area**

   - Display a rectangular grid overlay on top of the selected image.
   - The grid should be resizable **only** by dragging any of the four corners of the grid.
   - Restrict the grid from exceeding the boundaries of the image.

2. **Grid Manipulation**

   - Allow the user to resize the crop area by dragging any of the four corners of the grid.
   - Ensure smooth and responsive interaction when resizing the grid.
   - Restrict the grid from exceeding the boundaries of the image.

3. **Aspect Ratio Adjustment**

   - Provide predefined aspect ratio options (e.g., 1:1, 4:3, 16:9) for the crop area.
   - Allow the user to lock the aspect ratio while resizing the grid.
   - Include a "Free" mode where the user can define a custom aspect ratio.

4. **Image Scaling**

   - Enable zooming in and out of the image using pinch gestures and respect the pinch cetroid.
   - Ensure the image scales smoothly and remains centered within the crop area.
   - Set a maximum scale limit of **7x** to prevent excessive scaling.

5. **Save and Cancel Options**

   - Include a "Save" button that:
     - Crops the image based on the current crop area.
     - Closes the crop screen and returns to the main screen.
     - Updates the **image preview** on the main screen to display the cropped image.
   - Add a "Cancel" button to discard changes and return to the main screen without applying the crop.
   - Prompt the user for confirmation before discarding unsaved changes.

6. **Reapplying Crop**
   - If the user presses the "Crop" button again after a previous crop, the crop screen should open with the previously cropped image and the last applied crop state.
   - Allow the user to modify the crop area further and apply additional changes.

### **Non-Functional Requirements** ðŸ’¥

1. **Performance**

   - Ensure the application runs smoothly on devices with varying hardware capabilities.
   - Optimize image rendering and manipulation to avoid lag or stuttering.

2. **User Experience**

   - Design an intuitive and visually appealing interface.
   - Use consistent UI/UX patterns and follow Material Design guidelines.
   - Provide visual feedback for user actions (e.g., highlighting the active corner of the grid).

3. **Compatibility**

   - Test the application on multiple Android versions (e.g., API 21+).
   - Ensure compatibility with different screen sizes and orientations.

4. **Code Quality**
   - Write clean, modular, and well-documented code.
   - Follow best practices for Android development, such as MVVM architecture, data binding, and dependency injection.
   - Include unit tests and UI tests to validate functionality.

### **Submission Guidelines**

1. **Deliverables**

   - Submit the complete source code via a GitHub repository (Don't mention Andalusi in your repo name or description).
   - Include a README file explaining the project structure, dependencies, and instructions for running the application.

2. **Evaluation Criteria**

   - Functionality: Does the application meet all the specified requirements?
   - Performance: Is the application efficient and responsive?
   - Code Quality: Is the code clean, maintainable, and well-structured?
   - User Experience: Is the interface intuitive and visually appealing?

3. **Timeframe**
   - Candidates should complete the task within 2 weeks, submitting earlier is a bonus.
